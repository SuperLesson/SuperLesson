# How to contribute to Super Lesson?

We are really glad you are reading this, because we need volunteer contributors to help this project come to fruition.

## Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not already reported* by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/SuperLesson/SuperLesson/issues)
* If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one on GitHub](https://github.com/SuperLesson/SuperLesson/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
Be sure to include a *concise title* and a *clear description*, and be as thorough as possible. Also, include a *test case* demonstrating the unexpected behavior.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

First, create a [*feature request*](https://github.com/SuperLesson/SuperLesson/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFR%5D).

If your feature is sound and you want to contribute, just follow these steps:

* *Fork* the repository
* Follow the [*commit policy*](CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-policy)
* Submit a [*pull Request*](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests-policy)

## Commit Policy

This repo follows the traditional git conventions, laid out in [this post](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

In short, our guidelines are:

* Use the imperative voice in commit messages
* Descriptions detail WHAT and WHY, but never HOW (that's on code!)
* Reference issues and commits respectively with
    ```raw
    Closes: #123
    Fixes: abc0304 ("Commit message here")
    ```
    as necessary.
* Use git's standards for message length, 50 characters on the message and 72 on the description.

To ensure that both contributors are included in the GitHub commit graph, include the `Co-authored-by:` statement in the message:

```raw
Creating contributing guide

Co-authored-by: Autor 2 <autor2@mail.com>

```

## Pull Requests Policy

Pull requests should be made to the main branch. The pull request's description must include a clear description of what was done.

## Code style

We adopt flake-8 in this project, which follows the [PEP-8](pep8.org) specification.

## Do you want to say hello to us?
